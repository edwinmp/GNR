            <h1 class="h1-content">Thank you for your SMART commitment to step up the efforts on ending malnutrition in
                all its forms.
            </h1>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>This form is intended to facilitate the registration of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
                        Relevant, Time-bound) nutrition commitments, including for the Nutrition for Growth (N4G)
                        Summit.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each commitment constitutes a separate submission. Once you submit your first commitment you
                        will have the option to register additional ones.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each commitment can have up to ten goals. If your commitment has more than ten goals, please
                        take the survey again to add the additional goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>For the Tokyo N4G summit, commitments are encouraged to be registered by 31 October 2021 and the
                        summit will be the hard deadline for registering commitments for the Nutrition Year of Action.
                        If you submit your commitment by 31 October, the <a href="">Global Nutrition Report (GNR)</a>
                        will be able to
                        perform a basic level of verification. For those registered after 31 October, no verification
                        will be performed in time for the summit and so commitments registered after 31 October may not
                        be featured in the summit. All commitments registered between December 2020 and 8 December 2021
                        will be included in the Compact (Annex).
                    </li>
                    <li>The platform will remain open for stakeholders to make nutrition commitments at any point, but
                        it will not be linked to the Nutrition Year of Action or the Tokyo N4G Summit.
                    </li>
                    <li>The form should be completed in English. If that is not possible, please contact us. Over time
                        we will aim to support the registration of commitments in multiple languages.
                    </li>

                        reporting their progress annually.
